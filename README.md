# Hallway-Traffic-Project

//Here at BCA, with 4 minutes to reach your next class, time efficiency is key. Finding the quickest route to 
//get from one class to the next is ideal but difficult to predict due to the constantly busy and crowded hallways. 
//To provide a potential solution to this problem, we decided to begin creating a detection system within a camera 
//that would identify the number of students in one hallway and choose the most efficient routes. 
//This process will begin with a series of prototypes as we find the best camera, microprocessors, and microcontrollers suited for this detection system. 
//At its early stages, the project will consist of machine learning as we teach the camera to detect students based on hair color and write algorithms 
//that will count the collected data. After a series of tests and finding a system that works accurately, more advanced versions like multiple cameras 
//and connected GUIs will be made for a prototype application.
